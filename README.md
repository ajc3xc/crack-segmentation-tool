# Crack segmentation tool

The presented crack segmentation tool is designed to generate pixel-wise labaling of images of cracks in a semi-automatic manner. Its main goal is to simplify creation of a dataset to train deep learning algorithm for crack segmentation. The mathematical underpin for the algorithm was developed by Remco Duits and group of mathematical image analysis of Eindhoven University of Technology
